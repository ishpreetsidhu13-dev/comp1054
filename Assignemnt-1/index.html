            <h2>About the Song</h2>
            <p>When I hear the song East Side flow created by Sidhu Moose Wala, this song immediately makes me feel inspired and energized. The song is very strong vibe that makes me believe in myself and my way. It gives me the feeling that I am not afraid of anything as no challenge can be so great to halt my development.</p>
            <p>The point that is particularly interesting is that the song is confident and yet is brought down to earth and humorous. It also tells me that true power can never be found in flaunting, but rather by understanding who you are and being courageous in your beliefs. The rhythm and the spirit of the song makes me have excitement and determination particularly at those low moments or at a time when I feel weak.</p>
